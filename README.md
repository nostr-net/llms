# llms
Idea is to create a library of markdown files that provide context to any LLM for building nostr application. 

It includes snippets, explanations, documentation and other directions needed for the LLM to get all the directions and knowledge needed to build the app.

## rust-nostr
Context files for bindings generated from rust-nostr library
- [python](./rust-nostr/python-llms.txt) 
- [swift](./rust-nostr/swift-llms.txt) 
- [js](./rust-nostr/js-llms.txt)
